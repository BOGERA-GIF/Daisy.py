## Name
Library Management System Using Django

## Description 
This is an e-library where different kinds of books are posted by the librarians through their respective accounts and those interested can view and borrow them. User accounts will be created by the users through which they can access the library and request to borrow books. Failure to return the books on the required date will incurr a penalty upon the borrower.
The user will be notified a day before the book's due date reminding them to return the borrowed book. A book which is already borrowed is unavailable for other users.
